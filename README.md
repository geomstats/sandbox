# Sandbox

A place to share your code before merging it into the core codebase of Geomstats

# Guidelines

- Create a new folder for every new algorithm/feature that you would like to add.
- Add a description.md file explaining
  -  the content of the folder,
  -  the prefered method to contact you if we encounter issues,
  -  if applicable, the research paper associated with this code,
  -  if possible, the versions of the packages used to have it run.

Thank you for contributing to open-source geometric statistics and (deep) learning!
