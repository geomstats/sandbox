# Sandbox

Welcome to Geomstats' Sandbox! 

This repository is a place to share your code with the community of geometric statistics and (deep) learning. 

Following users' requests, the Geomstats team might decide to integrate this code into the core codebase.

# Guidelines

- Create a new folder for every new algorithm/feature that you would like to add.
- Add a description.md file explaining
  -  the content of the folder,
  -  the prefered method to contact you if we encounter issues, or indicate that you do not want to be contacted,
  -  if applicable, the research paper associated with this code,
  -  if possible, the versions of the packages used to have it run.

Thank you for contributing to open-source geometric statistics and (deep) learning!
